# These hints *may* assume linux/glibc. Other libc implementations,
# would they require different settings, should be added explicitly,
# as linux-(something), or perhaps even arch-linux-(something).
#
# The reason for this is in cases like arm-*-linux-gnueabi, -gnueabihf
# and so on which make it hard to guess libc type from the 4th component.
# In the same vein, stuff like i586-alix-linux-uclibc requies some effort
# to get when building toolchain, and if left to gcc configure, it is
# very likely to end up as i586-pc-linux-gnu or something along those lines,
# even if uClibc is used.
